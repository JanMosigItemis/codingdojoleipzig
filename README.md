## Structure

There is one subfolder for each kata. Each folder contains a README.md with description of the kata and a folder for a pattern solution (which is not necessarily the best solution) and one for the solution developed during the actual dojo. Depending on how the dojo evolved, the session solution may or may not be complete.
