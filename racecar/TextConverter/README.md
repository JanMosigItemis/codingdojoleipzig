HtmlTextConverter exercise: write the unit tests for the HtmlTextConverter class. The HtmlTextConverter class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser. For the Python and Java versions, there is an additional class "HtmlPagesConverter" which is slightly harder to get under test. It not only converts text from a file to html, it also supports pagination. It's meant as a follow up exercise.
