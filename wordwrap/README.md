## Word Wrapper

Write a program that takes a string and a so called column number. The program inserts line breaks ("wraps the input") at just the right places so that no line is any longer than column number. The wrapper tries to break lines at word boundaries if possible. The last space in a line will become a newline.

## Examples

"This is a long text", Column Number: 6. Results in:
"This\nis a\nlong\text"
